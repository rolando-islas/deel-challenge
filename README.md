# Observations

For this project I used a [Country Names API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3). There are some cases in which the results don't match a 100% the text, but this is because of the API. It uses other parameters for finding the countries, not only the name sent to the API. This is a behavior not controlled by me, but the API provider.
